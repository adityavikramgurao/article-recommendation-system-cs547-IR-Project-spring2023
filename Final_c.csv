Pakistan's economy has partially shut down and millions of people have lost jobs due to continuous political instability. The nation is destined to encounter hyperinflation with the domestic currency likely plunging to Rs500 against the US dollar if the situation persists.

Pakistan's economy has partially shut down and millions of people have lost jobs due to continuous political instability. The nation is destined to encounter hyperinflation with the domestic currency likely plunging to Rs500 against the US dollar if the situation persists.


Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif also anticipated late last week that the local currency could slump to Rs500 against the greenback, if the political situation worsens.
